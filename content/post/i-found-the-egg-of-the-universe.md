I accidentally re-discovered the cosmic Egg Theory.
<!--more-->


Playing with GPT API I generated the following conversation:

```
/usr/local/bin/python3.11 /Users/adrian/src/gptplay/test.py 
AI: hi, how can I help you?
Me: I found an egg

AI: Congratulations! What kind of egg is it?
Me: A toy egg

AI: Ah, that's fun. What is inside the egg?
Me: The whole universe fits in the egg, yet the egg is within the universe. Can you explain that?

AI: This is a Zen and Buddhist concept called the Cosmic Egg. It symbolizes the unity between everything 
in the universe - that all things are connected and part of the same whole. 
It suggests that the universe is both within and beyond each individual.
```

Context, my three years old just said "I found an egg!" So I repeated it to GPT with a formulation for a philosophical 
theory (I was just having fun) that was already invented long ago... I searched for references but could not find 
the exact theory, except for a book with low reviews and a Wikipedia article with many references from many cultures.
