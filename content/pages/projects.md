# New Terminal - RS-232 - Serial Port

* Date: ~2003
* Platform: Tested on Windows 95/98/NT
* Source code: https://github.com/deccico/new_rs232_terminal

This program can be used to connect to any device over the serial port (rs-232). It includes the ability to visualise 
both the HEXA and ASCII code received at the same time. Very useful for debugging. You can also program a set of 
input-output commands for any package. By doing so you can simulate any RS-232 device protocol.

# Voice Over IP Billing System

* Date: ~2002  
* Code: https://github.com/deccico/ip-speak
* Platform: Tested on  Windows 98 /NT / 2000 and XP over Cisco routers.

This system polls real time phone-calls information utilising SNMP from  (usually Cisco) routers. Records are stored in 
a database. The system utilise this database to generate different reports including historical data usage.

IP-Speak also manages up to 16 LCDs through the serial port and the protocol I2C. It also allows to customise 
the messages on screen. Other options include a backup and security module, setup for different kind of routers,
settings module and testing for LCD, serial port and SNMP.

Along with the system there is a web-app (not included in Github) to verify consumption and real-time billing.
