# Bellatrix

* Type: AWS Cloud Automation
* Date: 2011
* Platform: Tested on Windows and Linux.
* Source code: https://github.com/deccico/bellatrix

Bellatrix is a set of (magic) tools to automate the use of Amazon EC2 services. This utility, preceded the existence
of Packer when there was no such solution to automate the generation of AMIs. It also preceded the use of a serverless
architecture to manage devices one year earlier than Ansible. Clearly I made all the right architecture choices 
well in advance :)
By the time Bellatrix was released, engineers were trying to utilise Puppet instead to manage live cloud 
infrastructure, but I could clearly see the beauty of a static AMI generated by an immutable recipe as opposed to a 
client/server architecture than can't easily control the final state of their machines.
