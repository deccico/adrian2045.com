# Bellatrix

* Type: AWS Cloud Automation
* Date: 2011
* Platform: Tested on Windows and Linux.
* Source code: https://github.com/deccico/bellatrix

Bellatrix is a set of (magic) tools to automate the use of Amazon EC2 services. This utility, preceded the existence
of Packer when there was no such solution to automate the generation of AMIs. It also preceded the use of a serverless
architecture to manage devices one year earlier than Ansible. Clearly I made all the right architecture choices 
well in advance :)
By the time Bellatrix was released, engineers were trying to utilise Puppet instead to manage live cloud 
infrastructure, but I could clearly see the beauty of a static AMI generated by an immutable recipe as opposed to a 
client/server architecture than can't easily control the final state of their machines. 
Bellatrix gained some internet fame with many downloads (around 10k), cross-articles written about it and questions 
popping into StackOverflow.

# Arges

* Platform: Linux.

Arges scripts are very simple and emulate a very high level language from where you call the testing/execution actions. Arges provides a set of utilities for
rapid automated testing to interact with any kind of interfaces including the web ui side (by using Selenium) and the server side / command line testing.

It supports handling parameters, which are totally separated from the scripts.

Within the test scripts you call the actions which by now, are divides into three main categories:

-Web handling. From where you can interact with any web site. Selenium 1.0.1 library is used internally.

-Command line executions. To execute any kind of command and check the return code or its output.
